# SimReader

A Java parser for game data from the Sim* Franchise.

At the moment, this project only supports SimCity 4, but since many other Maxis games also use a similar format, it could be expanded to support those games too.

**This is still very much a work in progress and unlikely to be actively maintained.** This is mainly just a fun project for myself, but contributions are certainly welcome!
